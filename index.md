### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

I cleaned the Nashville Housing dataset using SQL by standardizing dates 📅, populating property addresses 🏠, breaking down addresses into separate columns 📍, converting "Y" or "N" to "Yes" or "No" in "Sold as Vacant" field ✅, removing duplicates 🔍, and deleting unused columns 🗑️. I used various SQL commands, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CAST, CONVERT, COUNT, JOIN, ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, CASE WHEN-THEN-END, DISTINCT, SUBSTRING, ROW_NUMBER() PARTITION BY(), WITH, and PARSENAME.

### Interpretable machine learning: Parital Dependence Plots, LIME and Shapley values

A significant barrier to ML's adoption in many fields is the lack of interpretability of black box models. In this project, I use several techniques to gain insights into various models.

### Using multi-level modelling in R to investigate the drivers of Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy

In many tasks, failing to account for the hierarchical relations and autocorrelations between data can create "ecological fallacies" which misguide our interpretation of the data. In this project, I use mutli-level regression modelling to account for spatial autocorrelation and study reasons for Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy.
